# user-rating-classification
In this project we tried to predict user ratings for unreleased video games. We used the video game distribution platform Steam to crawl video game ratings for already released games and tried to classify unseen games based on their attributes.

For the classification, we used the data mining tool RapidMiner. For more information on our results and methodology take a look at the project report in this repository.
